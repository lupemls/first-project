# first-project
This will be our first project for the coding boot camp.
Developers: Greivin, Violet, Riley and Matt

AS A video game enthusiast
I WANT TO easily research games
SO THAT I can make informed decisions and spend more time playing

Our site will take in a user input and use it to search through a list of games in the RAWG API to give us results for the Atari 2600. The results will be displayed with the name and image for each result. Clicking on any of the resulting images will pull up some additional images of that specific game, as well as some YouTube videos related to it (using the YouTube API), be they gameplay footage, reviews, or informative videos. A description will also be displayed, along with the release date and list of developers. There is also a random assortment of games to select when the page is loaded if you are not sure where to start, and clicking on one of those images will have the same functionality as clicking on one of the search results.
